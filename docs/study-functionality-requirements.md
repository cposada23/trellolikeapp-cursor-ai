# Study Functionality Requirements

## Overview
The study functionality allows users to practice flashcards from their decks in an interactive, gamified study session with real-time scoring and timing.

## User Journey
1. User clicks "Study" button on a deck from dashboard or deck view
2. User is redirected to `/study/deck/${deck.id}`
3. User sees study session setup with deck information
4. User clicks "Start Study" button to begin session
5. Timer starts and first random card is displayed
6. User studies the front of the card and enters their answer
7. User submits answer (Enter key or Validate button)
8. System shows feedback (correct/incorrect with animation)
9. Next random card is displayed
10. Process continues until all cards are completed
11. Final score and session summary are displayed

## Core Features

### 1. Study Session Initiation
- **Route**: `/study/deck/${deck.id}`
- **Prerequisites**: User must be authenticated and own the deck
- **Initial View**: 
  - Deck name and description
  - Number of cards in deck
  - "Start Study" button
  - Study session instructions

### 2. Timer System
- **Start**: Timer begins when "Start Study" button is clicked
- **Display**: Continuously visible during session (MM:SS format)
- **End**: Timer stops when session completes or is exited
- **Precision**: Track to seconds

### 3. Card Display System
- **Card Design**:
  - Rounded, aesthetic card UI using Shadcn UI Card components
  - Clean, modern styling consistent with app design
  - Smooth animations for card transitions
  - Front side visible by default
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes

- **Card Selection**:
  - Random order presentation
  - No card repetition in single session
  - All cards must be shown exactly once

- **Card Content**:
  - Clear, readable typography
  - Front side displays the question/prompt
  - Back side contains the correct answer (for reference)

### 4. Answer Input System
- **Input Field**:
  - Shadcn UI Input component
  - Positioned below the card
  - Placeholder text: "Enter your answer..."
  - Auto-focus when card loads
  - Clear after each submission

- **Submission Methods**:
  - "Validate" button (Shadcn UI Button)
  - Enter key press
  - Both methods trigger answer validation

### 5. Answer Validation & Feedback
- **Validation Logic**:
  - Compare user input with card's back content
  - Case-insensitive matching (ignore case differences)
  - Trim whitespace from both user input and correct answer

- **Correct Answer Feedback**:
  - Card flips to show the back side (correct answer) briefly
  - Green success animation/indicator
  - Brief positive message ("Correct!" or similar)
  - Increment score counter
  - Automatic progression to next card after short delay

- **Incorrect Answer Feedback**:
  - Card flips to show the back side (correct answer)
  - Red error animation/indicator
  - Show correct answer on flipped card
  - Brief feedback message
  - No score increment
  - Automatic progression to next card after short delay

### 6. Scoring System
- **Scoring Logic**:
  - +1 point for each correct answer
  - 0 points for incorrect answers
  - Running score display during session
  - Final score calculation: (correct answers / total cards) × 100

- **Score Display**:
  - Live counter visible during session
  - Format: "Score: X/Y" where X = correct, Y = total cards attempted
  - Final results show percentage and total points

### 7. Session Completion
- **End Conditions**:
  - All cards in deck have been shown
  - User completes the session naturally

- **Results Screen**:
  - Final score (points and percentage)
  - Total time taken
  - Number of cards studied
  - "Study Again" button (starts a new session with the same deck)
  - "Back to Dashboard" button

### 8. Navigation & Session Management
- **During Session**:
  - "Exit Study" button to leave session early
  - "Pause/Resume" button to pause and resume the study session
  - Confirmation dialog for exit action
  - Progress indicator (card X of Y)
  - Timer pauses when session is paused

- **Session State**:
  - No persistence across page refreshes (fresh start)
  - Session is lost if user navigates away from the page
  - Pause/resume functionality maintains session state temporarily

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Routing
- Route: `/study/deck/[id]/page.tsx`
- Dynamic route parameter validation
- Redirect to 404 if deck doesn't exist or user doesn't have access

### 2. Data Requirements
- Fetch deck details and all associated cards
- Verify deck ownership through authentication
- Handle empty decks gracefully

### 3. State Management
- Current card index
- Shuffled card order array
- Score counter
- Timer state (running, paused, stopped)
- Session status (setup, active, paused, completed)
- User input state
- Card flip state (front, back, flipping)
- Pause/resume functionality state

### 4. UI Components (Shadcn UI)
- Card components for flashcard display
- Button components for actions
- Input components for answers
- Alert/Badge components for feedback
- Progress indicators
- Dialog components for confirmations

### 5. Animations
- Card flip animations (front to back on answer submission)
- Card transition animations between different cards (smooth, modern)
- Success/error feedback animations
- Loading states and transitions
- Responsive hover effects
- Pause/resume button state animations

## Error Handling

### 1. No Cards in Deck
- Display message: "This deck has no cards to study"
- Prompt user to go to edit deck page to add cards
- Show "Add Cards" button that redirects to `/decks/${deck.id}/edit`
- Disable study functionality until cards are added

### 2. Network Errors
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Clear error messages to user

### 3. Invalid Deck Access
- Redirect to dashboard if deck doesn't exist
- Redirect to dashboard if user doesn't own deck
- Clear error messaging

## Performance Considerations
- Preload all cards for session (avoid loading delays)
- Optimize card transition animations
- Efficient state updates for real-time features
- Image optimization if cards contain images (future feature)

## Future Enhancements (Not in Initial Release)
- Study session history/statistics
- Different study modes (multiple choice, timed mode)
- Difficulty levels
- Spaced repetition algorithms
- Study streaks and achievements
- Collaborative study sessions

## Implementation Clarifications (Resolved)

✅ **Card Order**: Random presentation (no sequential option)
✅ **Empty Deck Handling**: Prompt user to go to edit deck page to add cards
✅ **Pause/Resume**: Include pause/resume functionality with timer pause
✅ **Navigation Away**: Study session is lost (no persistence)
✅ **Results Persistence**: No persistence for now (future enhancement)
✅ **Card Flip Animation**: Yes, card flips to show answer after submission
✅ **Answer Validation**: Case-insensitive matching
✅ **Card Transitions**: Smooth, animated transitions between cards
✅ **Session Restart**: No restart capability within session (only "Study Again" after completion)
✅ **Minimum Cards**: No minimum cards requirement
